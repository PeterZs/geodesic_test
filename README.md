This figure shows the geodesic distance of any point to the specified point in the mesh, computed by the method 
in the paper Geodesics in Heat:A New Approach to Computing Distance Based on Heat Flow. The white line shows the geodesic distance value contour line. The algorithm core is just solving a Poisson's equation! Elegant!
